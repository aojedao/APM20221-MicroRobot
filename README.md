## Description

This project is a differential self-driving vehicle (SDV) with 2D perception for a printed circuit board (PCB) microfactory using flexible operation processes. Using a Raspberry Pi 3B and a BeagleBone Blue, a 5.02 kg payload-carrying robot is designed and manufactured. Perception is achieved using a RPLidar A1 and Hector SLAM mapping.
